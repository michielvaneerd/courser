# Courser
With Courser you can learn words by creating a courses, add words to them and learn them even when no network connection is available. You can also save your courses to Dropbox and share your courses with others.

# Usage
Creating a course is a 2 step process: 1) create the course 2) add entries.

__In the below explanation the example is a course to learn Chinese from English. But you can learn everuthing as long it has a source and a destination!__

__Create the course by entering some information__
* Title _Chinese - English Course_
* Source _Chinese_
* Destination _English_
* Test success count _1_ (this means that when doing the test we have to succeed for each entry 1 time)
* Test types _Show Chinese, select English_ and _Show English, select Chinese_ (this means the test will show a Chinese word and let you choose between 4 English words, or vice versa)
* Other test types are _Show Chinese, type English_ and _Show English, type Chinese_ that will allow you to type the correct answer instead of choosing between 4 answers.

__Add some entries__
Each entry can have the source (in our example Chinse), destination (English) and phonetic (pronounciation, so in the case of Chinese you could enter the pinyin).

__Shuffle__
While learning words, it's best to have the order of the list be random. This can be done with the _Shuffle_ function. You can choose if you want to see the Chinese or English words en you can shuffle the list. Click a listitem to display the meaning.

__Test__
You'll see a Chinese or English word and you have to choose between 4 meanings.
